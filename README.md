### Update me pls

A project built with rust, which will be compiled to js or smth to be published into npm. 

The ideea of the project is, it will scan all .ts / .d.ts files and will copy all content where it finds word type or interface and it will copy to an types.d.ts or smth. 

And for example, for the backend side of project is super benefical because on the build i can generate this file and then copy it into the frontend

Or it can be an cli i guess
